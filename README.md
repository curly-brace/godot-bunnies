# godot-bunnies
###Godot Engine bunny mark

there are two interchangable levels

first uses draw_texture to paint directly on screen (on node2d actually)

second uses sprite nodes

there is a single script that handles all the stuff and convenient buttons to add and remove bunnies

actually the difference in native build between theese two methods is drastic (sprite nodes win), but in html5 the difference is not very noticable (both are slow)
